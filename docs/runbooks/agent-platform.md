# Runbook: the agent platform (specs 017–022)

Named agents per resource, the `@ai0` builder, native multi-platform posts, playbooks and the idea pool, the MANAGER
and cross-promo between own resources. Everything below runs inside the automation service; there is no new process.

## 1. Enable

1. **Migrations** `049_agents` … `054_network_promo` apply at boot (MigrationRunnerService) or with `database/migrate.sh`.
   All are additive and idempotent. Number `048` is reserved by spec 011 (deal agent) and is not used yet.
2. **Prerequisites** from the editor runbook: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and `EDITOR_ENABLED=true` for scheduled runs.
3. **On first boot** the registry sync creates an orchestrator `@<channel>` (with planner, executor, reviewer and idea
   reviewer roles) for every editor card. It also loads `editor-skills/*.md` into the `skills` table. Open `/app/agents`.
4. **`@manager` starts in mode `off`.** Set it to `shadow` on its page: it then reviews the network at its times and
   stores directives without delivering them. Switch it to `live` once its reviews look sensible.
5. **Proxy.** The promo redirect `/r/:code` is a bare-root route. It has been added to `apps/dashboard/nginx.conf` and the vite
   dev proxy. If Caddy sits in front, it must forward `/r/*` too.

## 2. Environment

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `EDITOR_ORCHESTRATION` | on | `off` disables the daily orchestrator runs (playbooks, idea pool). Planning and publishing work as before. |
| `EDITOR_MODEL_<ROLE>` / `EDITOR_REASONING_<ROLE>` | — | Per-role model and reasoning effort. New roles: `ORCHESTRATOR`, `IDEA_REVIEWER` (default `z-ai/glm-5.3`), `MANAGER`, `BUILDER`. |
| `DIRECTIVE_TIMEOUT_HOURS` | 12 | How long a structural directive waits for the owner. |
| `DIRECTIVE_TIMEOUT_APPLY_KINDS` | — | Comma list of kinds that apply on timeout. All others are dropped. |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `DASHBOARD_URL` | Base of tracked UTM links (`<base>/r/<code>`). Without it, UTM links are untracked. |
| `PROMO_HASH_SALT` | derived from `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Salt for the hashed user ids of joins. |
| `TIKTOK_PRIVACY_LEVEL` | `SELF_ONLY` | TikTok posts stay private until the app passes TikTok's audit. |

## 3. Networks (one brand on several platforms)

- **A network is an account group** (`/app/connections/groups`) with a Telegram channel and Meta and/or TikTok accounts.
  - TikTok accounts can now join a group too, through `tiktok_accounts.group_id`.
  - The network is run by **the orchestrator of its Telegram channel**.
- **How a network goes from mirroring to native posts:**
  1. Give the agent a brief in the chat (`@ai0 новий бриф для @kira: …`) or on its Playbook tab ("Rebuild from brief").
  2. The orchestrator drafts a playbook and the idea reviewer comments on it.
  3. You approve it on the Playbook tab.
  4. Switch the network to **Orchestrated** on the same tab. Mirrors of Telegram posts stop for that network, and the
     planner plans native slots for every resource.
- **Shadow first.** Platform posts in shadow are stored in `platform_posts` (status `shadowed`) and sent to you as
  previews. Nothing is posted until the anchor channel's card **and** the orchestrator are `live`.

## 4. Daily cycle (Kyiv time)

| When | What |
|---|---|
| Card plan hour (default 06:00) | The orchestrator's daily run: it resolves directives and tops up the idea pool. The idea reviewer reviews new ideas. Then the planner plans the day; in a network, it plans all resources. |
| Every minute | Due slots run. Telegram slots use the editor executor. Instagram, Facebook, Threads and TikTok slots use the platform executor. Reserved slots (ads, chat posts, promos) are published by code. |
| 08:00, 13:00, 18:00, 22:30 | `@manager` reviews the KPI digest. If nothing changed and there is no anomaly, the run is skipped without an LLM call. |
| Hourly | Registry sync (:17), expired confirmation cards and shadow → "go live?" cards (:23), and directive timeouts, expiry and effect evaluation (:47). |
| Every 3 h | Platform post metrics plus a daily follower rollup (`resource_daily_stats`). |
| 05:40 | Review of skill self-edits: kept, or rolled back on a KPI drop. |
| 06:10 | Resource health check. A resource that becomes unusable triggers a card, and nothing is planned on it until it is fixed. |

## 5. Owner controls

- **Pausing:**
  - one agent: its page → Pause (indefinitely, 24 h, or until a date);
  - a whole network: pause its orchestrator;
  - every scheduled run: `EDITOR_ENABLED=false`;
  - the LLM-free reserved publishing (ads, scheduled chat posts) keeps running on purpose.
- **Skills:** edit, override, lock or roll back on the agent page's Skills tab.
  - Agents may self-edit at most one skill a day. You get an inbox item with the diff.
  - A self-edit is rolled back automatically when views per post drop ≥ 15 % beyond the noise band within 7 days.
  - Safety skills (`fact-check`, `source-licensing`) and locked skills cannot be edited by agents.
- **Chat** (`/app/chat`):
  - Mention `@handle` to talk to an agent, `@ai0` to create or change agents, `@manager` to ask about the network.
  - Every change is a card with Apply / Discard.
- **Inbox** (`/app/agents/inbox`): skill self-edits and rollbacks, pending playbooks, structural directives, go-live
  offers and resource health.

## 6. Platform limits to know

- **TikTok:** API posts stay private until the app is audited. The images must be hosted on a domain verified in the
  TikTok developer portal, because the slide hosting bucket is pulled by URL.
- **YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok video:** these need spec 019b (after the shorts-studio bridge, spec 016).
  The capability matrix marks them "not yet", so agents cannot plan them.
- **Instagram:** links in captions are not clickable. Agents write "посилання в біо" and may add a first comment.
- **Tracked Telegram invite links** need our bot to be an admin of the target channel with the invite right.
  - Joins are counted from `chat_member` updates, which the admin bot (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`) receives.
  - Channels on another bot fall back to public links, and their joins are unknown.

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| No agent for a channel | `/app/agents` triggers a sync. Also check that the channel has an editor card. |
| Orchestrator never runs | `EDITOR_ENABLED`, `EDITOR_ORCHESTRATION`, the card mode is not `off`, the agent is not paused, and budgets on its page. |
| Network plan missing | The group mode is Orchestrated **and** there is an active playbook. Check the planner run on the agent's History tab. |
| Directive stuck | The `@manager` → Directives board. `awaiting_owner` waits for you; `new` is delivered on the orchestrator's next run. |
| Promo refused | The directive's resolution says why: pair cooldown, low relevance, health, no window, or proximity to an ad. |
| Platform post failed | `platform_posts.error`, and the resource health on the agent page. |

## 8. Live evals (owner key)

```bash
cd apps/automation && EVAL_DB_URL=<scratch PG> npx tsx --env-file=../../.env evals/run-evals.ts --case builder-onboarding,mention-explain,playbook-from-brief,idea-review,network-plan-staggered,platform-native-variant,manager-stable-continue,manager-drop-directive
```

The baseline is `evals/results/baseline-2026-10-02-agents.md`: 18/18, about $0.05 for the whole suite.

## 9. Setup from history (spec 042)

The onboarder reads an own channel's last 20 posts and proposes its agent's setup. Nothing changes until you apply a section.

**Needs**

- Migration `080_channel_setup`.
- A model key: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or the Anthropic key. `EDITOR_ENABLED` is not needed; the owner starts each run.
- The channel is marked as yours (`tracked_channels.is_mine`).
- For channels with fewer than 20 stored posts, a logged-in tracking userbot that can read the channel. It tops up `tracked_posts` once, with up to 50 messages.

**Use**

- Open `/app/setup` (Agents → Setup from history). You can also use "Set up from history" on a channel agent's page, or ask `@ai0` with `analyze_channel_history`.
- Tick channels and choose **Analyze selected**. The confirm shows the cost, which is the average of the last 20 successful onboarder runs. There is no estimate before the first run.
- Each run takes about a minute. The worker runs one channel at a time, every minute and at boot. Rows refresh by themselves.
- Open a proposal. Each section shows "now → proposed" and the posts it rests on. Tick the sections you want, then choose **Apply selected**.
- Sections are written in order: brief and profile, formatting, format mix, series and pillars, schedule, examples and voice. Apply stops at the first failure, and the dialog names the section that failed.
- What Apply keeps and writes:
  - Owner-locked formatting fields and locked series are kept.
  - A new series is written as locked, and its origin is the owner.
  - The voice goes to the agent skill `channel-voice`, for the executor and the checker.
- A channel without an editor card gets one in mode **off**, and its agent is created by the registry sync. Nothing publishes until you switch the mode.

**Statuses**

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `queued` / `collecting` / `analyzing` | Running. A FLOOD_WAIT puts the run back in the queue with a retry time; a run stuck for 15 min is requeued. |
| `ready` / `partially_applied` | Waiting for you. A new analysis of the same channel supersedes the open proposal. |
| `no_access` | The tracking account cannot read the channel. Add it to the channel, then analyze again. |
| `too_few_posts` | Fewer than 5 usable posts. The model is not called. |
| `failed` | The reason is on the row. The run trace is under "Open the run" (role `onboarder`, usage feature `editor.onboarder`, at most 4 steps and $0.30). |

**Changed since analysis**

If you edited a section after the analysis, Apply refuses that section and applies the rest. Analyze again to review it with the new values.
